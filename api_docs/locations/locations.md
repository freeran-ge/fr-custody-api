## Description

Location parameters were designed to be agnostic regardless of jurisdiction. 
For example, documenting the location of a key storage device in Costa Rica would be difficult using 
a traditonal address schema, as many streets have no name and many buildngs do not have numbers assigned.

Latitude and Longitude are available parameters, along with fields such as `landmark` and `natural_feature`.
We tried to account for multiple methodologies when choosing a location for storing device and seed backups, from
bank locations where safe deposit boxes are located, to

| Properties | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `administrative_area_level_1` | indicates a first-order civil entity below the country level. Within the United States, these administrative levels are states. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels. In most cases, administrative_area_level_1 short names will closely match ISO 3166-2 subdivisions and other widely circulated lists; however this is not guaranteed as our geocoding results are based on a variety of signals and location data. |
| `administrative_area_level_2` | indicates a second-order civil entity below the country level. Within the United States, these administrative levels are counties. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels. |
| `administrative_area_level_3` | indicates a third-order civil entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor civil division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels. |
| `administrative_area_level_4` | indicates a fourth-order civil entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor civil division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels. |
| `administrative_area_level_5` | indicates a fifth-order civil entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor civil division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels. |
