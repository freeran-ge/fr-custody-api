# FreeRange Custody 

`fr-custody-api` is a bank-grade solution for organizations wanting to self-custody digital assets.

The primary objective of this API is to quickly help organizations deploy and manage cold-storage operations at scale. 

#### Key design features include:

- **Bank-grade custody.** Originally designed for banks *(including our own)* seeking compliance with the Wyoming Division of Banking's rules for digital asset custody. See FreeRange's story in [Wired Magazine](https://www.wired.com/story/newest-haven-cryptocurrency-companies-wyoming/).    
- **Powerful analytics for risk management.** Built on a graph database with technical assistance from Sandia National Laboratories *through the New Mexico Small Business Assistance program.* 
> *Note: Sandia National Laboratories are also customers of FreeRange for digital asset risk management and procrument. Find out more about the mission of Sandia National Labs [here](https://www.sandia.gov).*   

**Security is our primary focus.** Unlike 3rd party custodial solutions such as Curv and Anchorage, FreeRange never stores, generates or has access to an organization's private keys.

The technical build overview can be found [here](/build_overview.md).

## Database Schema Overview

`fr-custody-api` uses a graph database model that gives a greater emphasis on relationships.

Use the API to build custom self-custody models, then leverage graph-based queries to analyze risk and compliance with custody standards such as those from the CryptoCurrency Certification Consortium (C4) which can be found [here](https://cryptoconsortium.github.io/CCSS/).

Summary for Developers: 
- Nodes are the main data elements
- Nodes are connected to other nodes via relationships
- Relationships connect two nodes
- Both Nodes and Relationships can have one or more properties (i.e., attributes stored as key/value pairs)

Below are the table overviews for nodes and relationships in the FreeRange graph database schema. 

## Nodes Overview

> *Note: More detailed tables defining the properties of each node can be found by clicking on the links in the left column.*

### General

| Nodes | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| [`organizations`](#organizations) | Groups of people collectively managing digital assets and/or their respective cryptographic public / private key pairings |
| [`accounts`](#accounts) | Collections of managed `wallet_addresses` belonging to the same blockchain network, grouped for accounting purposes |
| [`public_keys`](#public-keys) | Cryptographic keys assigned to `accounts`, of which private key pairings are managed by `organizations`, and are used for signing `transactions` |
| [`wallet_addresses`](#wallet-addresses) | An address on a blockchain network used for the assignment and accounting of digital assets |

### Key Management Related 

| Nodes | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`facilities`](#facilities) | An installation, building, or segerated space within used for the operations of organizations. Examples would be a house, bank branch, etc. Some facilities will be more hardened and have different levels of access control than others. |
| [`computers`](#computers) | Electronic devices used in processing and / or storing data related to key management, including `key_ceremonies`. An example would be an "air-gapped" notebook.  |
| [`containers`](#containers) | A physical object (ideally within a building) used for storing and securing items such as `key_storage_devices`. An example would be a safe deposit box or Faraday bag. Multiple types of `containers` can be nested within each other. |
| [`entropy_sources`](#entropy-sources) | Software, hardware, or analog derived (ex. deck of cards) randomness used in generating keys during `key_ceremonies` |
| [`key_ceremonies`](#key-ceremonies) | Procedural events where `organizations` generates unique public / private root keys used to store digital assets |
| [`key_managers`](#key-managers) | Members of `organizations` that has access to, and / or helps generate public / private key pairs |
| [`key_storage_devices`](#key-storage-devices) | A medium that stores public / private key pairs (ex. a Trezor or a piece of paper) |
| [`rooms`](#rooms) | A physical space within a facility, such as a vault for storing and securing `key_storage_devices`, or a  windowless room for holding `key_ceremony` events. |
| [`seeds`](#seeds) | Mnemonic phrases generated by `organizations` during a `key_ceremonies`, associated with and helps recover `wallet_addresses` tied to `key_storage_devices` |
| [`seed_backups`](#seed-backups) | (M of N) physical mediums (ex. engraved titanium plates) used to distribute portions of a `seed` amongst different geographical locations, allowing `organizations` to recover access to digital assets in case of `key_storage_device` failure. Idealy resistant to EMP, blast, fire, flood, etc |

### Other

| Nodes| Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`locations`](#locations) | These nodes describe the name and position of a physical item using addresses, coordinates, and / or landmarks. Other nodes (example: a safe deposit box `container` or a `key_manager`) can be connected to a `location` node via the `located_at` relationship to track and visualize geographic distribution of key management systems. If multiple `containers` are nested within each other (example: a safe deposit box nested within a vault nested within a facility) the `location` node should only attach to the parent `container` |

## Relationships Overview

### General

| Relationships| Description |
| --- | --- |
| `assigned_to` | Connects `public_keys`, `wallet_addresses`, and other nodes to an `account`. Useful for proof-of-reserve audits  |
| `belongs_to` | Connects `key_managers`, `key_storage_devices`, `entropy_sources`, and other nodes to an `organization` |
| `beneficiary_of` | Tracks who the beneficiary of an account is (optional). Can be a customer of an `organization` or the `organization` itself |
| `located_at`| Tracks the location of other nodes. An example would be `key_storage_device` => `located_at` => `location` |
| `transaction` | Events where `wallet_addresses` sends or receives digital assets on a blockchain ledger |

### Key Management Related

| Relationships| Description |
| --- | --- |
| `access` | Tracks `key_manager` access to a `location`, `container`, `key_storage_device` etc. |
| `generated` | Connects `key_generation_ceremonies` to the `seeds` that they generated  |
| `participated_in` | Connects `key_managers` to any `key_generation_ceremonies` they participated in  |
| `private_key_pair_stored_on` | Connects `public_keys` to the `key_storage_device` where the corresponding private key pair is stored. Note that the database never stores nor has access to private keys. |
| `required_for_signature` | Connects which `public_keys` are needed to sign a transaction for a `wallet_address`. Can be one `public_key` for a single signature wallet, up to 7 for a multi-sig wallet  |
| `seeded` | Connects which `seed` was used to initalize a `key_storage_device` during a `key_generation_ceremony` |
| `stored_in` | Connects `key_storage_devices` and `seed_backups` to the `containers` which they are stored in. Multiple types of `containers` can be nested within each other. An example would be `key_storage_device` => `stored_in` => a safe depost box `container` => `stored_in` => a bank vault `container`. This chaining becomes valuable when managng different layers of access control to containers through the `has_access_to` relationship. |

| `description` | A short description of the seed. |
| `mnemonic_words_total` | The total number of words used in the mnemonic.  |
| `risk_of_compromise` | Indicates the risk of a compromised seed, on a scale from 1-99, with `1` indicating the lowest risk of compromise and and `99` offering the highest level of risk. An example of increased risk is relying on only one source of entropy for generation. |

### Locations

Location parameters were designed to be agnostic regardless of jurisdiction. 
For example, documenting the location of a key storage device in Costa Rica would be difficult using 
a traditonal address schema, as many streets have no name and many buildngs do not have numbers assigned.

Latitude and Longitude are available parameters, along with fields such as `landmark` and `natural_feature`.
We tried to account for multiple methodologies when choosing a location for storing device and seed backups, from
bank locations where safe deposit boxes are located, to

| `administrative_area_level_1` | indicates a first-order civil entity below the country level. Within the United States, these administrative levels are states. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels. In most cases, administrative_area_level_1 short names will closely match ISO 3166-2 subdivisions and other widely circulated lists; however this is not guaranteed as our geocoding results are based on a variety of signals and location data. |
| `administrative_area_level_2` | indicates a second-order civil entity below the country level. Within the United States, these administrative levels are counties. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels. |
| `administrative_area_level_3` | indicates a third-order civil entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor civil division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels. |
| `administrative_area_level_4` | indicates a fourth-order civil entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor civil division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels. |
| `administrative_area_level_5` | indicates a fifth-order civil entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor civil division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels. |
